# Leetcode Algorithm

## 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

* Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

## 2001. Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles

* You are given `n` rectangles represented by a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i] = [widthi, heighti]` denotes the width and height of the `ith` rectangle.
* Two rectangles `i` and `j` (`i < j`) are considered **interchangeable** if they have the **same** width-to-height ratio. More formally, two rectangles are **interchangeable** if `widthi/heighti == widthj/heightj` (using decimal division, not integer division).
* Return *the **number** of pairs of **interchangeable** rectangles in* `rectangles`.
